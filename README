The `original version`_ of this package (by Harry Fuecks) is on Google
Code.  However, that version is currently unmaintained, so a `forked
version`_ (maintained by Song Liu) has sprung up on GitHub.

For usage information, browse the docstrings.

To test the package, install nose_ and run::

  $ nosetests --with-doctest apachelog
